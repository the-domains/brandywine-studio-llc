  A few weeks ago I started a new series called Residential Architecture 101 and
  the first item we reviewed was material transitions in exterior applications,
  and yes, it was mind-blowing!! (read it here) Today, however, I would like to
  take a look at exterior shutters, which are very common and frequently the
  target of DIY'ers and weekend warriors.
